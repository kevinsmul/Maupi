Miss Montreal - Golden
If you want it, if you need it
There is no way back, just leave it all behind
I have tried to wake you up, up
But the hours went too fast so I have to go now
Save it or wait now
I wanna see more

Will here be golden people in this world today
If you’d just see what some days are, ooh
When you just need some time
Well, I will give you more
You just listen to these words
Why did you turned around today

If I don’t hold, if I hurt you
I could leave now but I won’t, for you
If I live for, if I die for you, will you hold on
Please don’t leave, no
You’re the only one now
To save my world now
I wanna see more

Will there be golden people in this world today
If you’d just see what some days are, ooh
When you just need some time
Well, I will give you more
You just listen to these words
Why you turn around today

Some things will never be the same
Some days will end with lots of pain
So gave away, what do you say
Don’t want to be stuck in delay
Is this the price we have to pay
Well I don’t care

If you are golden, you need to save my world today 
If you’d just see what some days are
Ooh, when you just need some time
Well, I will give you more
You just listen to those words
Why you turned around today

You are golden and you need to save my world today
If I’d just see what some days are
When I just need some time
Well, you would give me more
I will listen to your words
Will you go with me today
